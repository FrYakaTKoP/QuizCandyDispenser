QuizCandyDispenser
===================

Welcome to the Quiz Based Educational 3D Printed Candy Dispenser

History and About
-------------
The Project was born in a [**Discord Group**](https://discordapp.com/invite/KWpvRSs) Fan Group of the famous 3D Print Youtuber [**Choas Drucker**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ufgBishob).  Please check out his [**Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ufgBishob) on youtube. 

The Initial Idea is a Candy Dispenser where you have to solve a question or similar, to get the Candy. The Hardware shall be mostly 3d printed or easy to source hardware. Like the very common RAMPS with lcd kit as the mainboard or the 9g hobby servo as actuator. 

Project Status
-----------

Still pretty early phase of the project.  Inital Target is a to fix the "to Buy" Hardware, draw schematics and write a initial Hardware test program.

- Window (still unclear most likely a 100x150 photo frame) *TODO: Add dimension *


Electrical Connections / Schematic
-------------

- Plug the Ramps board to the arduino mega
- connect Servo to Xmax endstop input (servo signal to pin1)
- connect Input Button A to Ymin endstop
- connect Input Button B to Ymax endstop
- connect Input Button C to Zmin endstop
- connect Input Button D to Zmax endstop
- plugin the lcd adapter
- connect lcd cables
- plug in the Arduino to USB to power it
- it should work now (you need to flash the firmware and prepare sd card first, if not done allready)
