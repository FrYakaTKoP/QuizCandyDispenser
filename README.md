Mechanical Design by Lofwyr


History and About
-------------
The Project was born in a [**Discord Group**](https://discordapp.com/invite/KWpvRSs) Fan Group of the famous 3D Print Youtuber [**Choas Drucker**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ufgBishob).  Please check out his [**Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ufgBishob) on youtube. 

The Initial Idea is a Candy Dispenser where you have to solve a question or similar, to get the Candy. The Hardware shall be mostly 3d printed or easy to source hardware. Like the very common RAMPS with lcd kit as the mainboard or the 9g hobby servo as actuator. 

Project Status
-----------

Still pretty early phase of the project.  Inital Target is a to fix the "to Buy" Hardware, draw schematics and write a initial Hardware test program.

Thanks to **waschbaerbauch75** for taking pictures

- Plug the Ramps board to the arduino mega
- connect Servo to SER1 Servo output and also put a jumper between 5V and Vcc (header left of the reset switch)  
  refer to this picture:

Thanks to **waschbaerbauch75** for taking pictures

- connect Input Button A to Xmin endstop
- connect Input Button B to Xmax endstop
- connect Input Button C to Ymin endstop
- connect Input Button D to Ymax endstop
- plugin the lcd adapter
- connect lcd cables
- plug in the Arduino to USB to power it
- it should work now (you need to flash the firmware and *prepare sd card first*, if not done allready)
